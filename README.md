# GRAPHQL-API-MONGODB
GRAPHQL-API-MONGODB is a code repository containing API endpoints built using GraphQL and a MongoDB database.

# GraphQL Learnings

This repository contains code related to learning GraphQL with Node.js and MongoDB.

## Description

This project aims to provide examples and tutorials for implementing GraphQL APIs using Node.js and MongoDB.

## Installation

To run this project locally, make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed.

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone git@github.com:nagarajalva5790/GRAPHQL-API-MONGODB.git


2. Install dependencies:
    cd graphql-learnings
    npm install

3: Prerequiste:
    Replace <username> and <passowrd> with your atlas mongoDB user name and password in index.js file
    mongodb+srv://<username>:<passowrd>@cluster0.o1i63zh.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

4. Usage
    After installing dependencies, you can start the project using the following command:
    npm start

    This will start the server using nodemon which will automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code (index.js).
